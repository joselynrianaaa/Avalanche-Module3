# Jo Token

The Jo Token contract represents an ERC-20 compliant token on the Ethereum blockchain. This token contract allows the owner to mint new tokens, burn tokens, and transfer tokens between addresses. Below is the documentation to help you understand, deploy, and interact with the Jo Token.

## Description

The Jo Token contract is developed in Solidity, a programming language for creating smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This ERC-20 token has features such as minting, burning, and transferring, making it suitable for various decentralized applications.

## Getting Started

### Executing Program

To run the Jo Token contract, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE.

1. Visit the Remix website at [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. Create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar.
3. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., JoToken.sol).
4. Copy and paste the Jo Token contract code into the file.

### Interacting with the Contract

Once deployed, you can interact with the Jo Token contract:

- Call the `mint` function to create new tokens. Only the owner can perform this action.
- Call the `burn` function to destroy tokens. Any user can perform this action.
- Call the `transferFrom` function to transfer tokens between addresses. Ensure proper allowance is set.
